### HCC Adding Richer Array of Low-level Optimizations

* 24-bit integer multiply and multiply-add (__mul24 and __mad24)
* Intrinsics for ds_permute and ds_bpermute (__amdgcn_ds_permute and __amdgcn_ds_bpermute)
* Intrinsics for ds_swizzle (__amdgcn_ds_swizzle)
* Intrinsics for wave shift and rotate by one thread (__amdgcn_wave_*)
* Intrinsic for move dpp (__amdgcn_move_dpp)
* Example of HCC Fuctions

```C++ 
unsigned int hc::__activelaneid_u32 () __HC__ 
```

Get the number of earlier (in flattened work-item order) active work items in the same wavefront.

```C++ 
uint64_t hc::__activelanemask_v4_b64_b1 (unsigned int input) __HC__ 
```
Return a bit mask showing which active work items in the wavefront have a nonzero input.

``` C++ 
unsigned int hc::__activelanecount_u32_b1 (unsigned int input) __HC__ 
```

Count the number of active work items in the current wavefront that have a nonzero input.

``` C++ 
unsigned int hc::__activelanepermute_b32 (unsigned int src, unsigned int laneId, unsigned int identity, unsigned int useIdentity) __HC__ 
```

Permute the active work items in the wavefront.

```C++ 
int hc::__any (int predicate) __HC__ 
```

Evaluate the predicate for all active work items in the wavefront and return a nonzero value if and only if every predicate evaluates to a nonzero value.

```C++ int hc::__all (int predicate) __HC__ ```

Evaluate the predicate for all active work items in the wavefront and return a nonzero value if and only if any one predicate evaluates to a nonzero value.

```C++ 
uint64_t hc::__ballot (int predicate) __HC__ 
```

Evaluate the predicate for all active work items in the wavefront and return an integer whose Nth bit is set if and only if the predicate evaluates to a nonzero value for the Nth work item of the wavefront and the Nth work item is active.

```C++
C++ unsigned int hc::__shfl_xor (unsigned int var, int laneMask, int width=__HSA_WAVEFRONT_SIZE__) __HC__ 
```
